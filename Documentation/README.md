# EBI_Huntington-s_disease
Huntington's disease study that is focused on understanding what molecular variations are associated with the progression of early-onset Huntington's disease?

Huntington's disease is a hereditary neurodegenerative disorder caused by an expansion of CAG repeats in the HTT gene, leading to a mutant huntingtin protein that damages neurons. It typically presents in adulthood with symptoms such as involuntary movements, cognitive decline, and psychiatric changes. The disease is progressive, and while no cure exists, research is focused on therapies to reduce the production of the mutant protein.
